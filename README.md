# ios-meme-generator

A rather rudimentary meme editor iOS app. Makes use of Meme Generator API.

The fun twist here is that instead of having the whole tempate database thrown on you at once, you get 10 randomly picked templates.
Now *THAT's* entertainment!

You can re-roll the dice and get another set of randomly-chosen templates.

## TODO
* actually style it
* make the meme downloadable as a picture
